# dat-http-proxy

> A tool for replicating dats stored at static http/s web addresses.

Donâ€™t know what a dat is? [Learn more here](https://datproject.org).

## Why

Dat is awesome, but at the moment it can become expensive if you are storing large datasets on a VPS. This tool helps you cheaply add redundancy to your peer to peer network by enabling you to serve multiple read-only dat archives from static web hosts.

With this library you can setup one server with minimal storage and serve any number of large dats that are stored elsewhere.

**Note:** If you are only storing small dats - look at [Hashbase.io](https://hashbase.io). It is a great service which at the moment offers a free tier for dats up to 100MB.

## Install

To use as a CLI utility

```
npm install dat-http-proxy -g
```

or to use from within another project

```
npm install dat-http-proxy --save
```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

**To replicate a single url:**

```
dat-http-proxy [url]
```

**To manage multiple urls:**

To use as a cli you need to create a file called `url-feeds` containing a list of urls.

For example:
```
http://dats.metadada.xyz/openaustralia/senate_debates/
http://dats.metadada.xyz/openaustralia/representatives_debates/
http://dats.metadada.xyz/openaustralia/members/
```

Then simply run `dat-http-proxy` from the command line.
If you modify the `url-feeds` file, the `dat-http-proxy` process will update live adding or removing connections to the url.

**Note:** At the moment this application will fail hard if you pass a malformed url.

### API

Simply import the package into your project.

```js
// es6
import httpProxy from 'dat-http-proxy'
// commonjs
var httpProxy = require('dat-http-proxy')
```

`var dats = httpProxy.all()`

Return all loaded dat archives. Explicitly ignores those loading or scheduled for removal.

`var urls = httpProxy.urls()`

Returns all the urls currently being served. Explicitly ignores those loading or scheduled for removal.

`var dat = httpProxy.add(url)`

Attempts to load a url as a dat archive and begins serving it. Returns a promise which resolves to a dat instance.

`httpProxy.remove(url)`

Removes the url and closes the associated dat archive.
